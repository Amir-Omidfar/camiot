## Camera+IOT project

 
***UCLA HCI professor Anthony's Chen summer 2019***

### Project Description:

In this project we aim to create a remote controller for home appliances that recognize each device taking and processing its picture. 

The assumption for the method of communication between the controller and the devices, is a wireless system (using either Wifi or RF's). 

The challenge is to develop an solid algorithm that can perform a well recognition even if the pictures taken do not include the device in the center. (Including all edge cases).
